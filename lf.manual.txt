NAME
  lf - list files matching a regular expression

SYNOPSIS
  lf [OPTIONS] PATTERN...

DESCRIPTION
  lf lists the file and directory that matching the given pattern.
  It likes find (1) on UNIX like system, but find (1) use wildcard
  charcacter substitute for any other character or  characters  in
  file name, like the asterisk character ("*") substitutes for any
  zero or more characters, and the question mark ("?") substitutes
  for any one character. But lf use regular expression, it provide
  more concise and flexible means for matching strings of path and
  file name.

OPTIONS
  -a, --all
        Do not ignore hidden file.
  -A, --absolute-path
        Always show absolute path.
  -e, --exec command
        Execute command. The file/director names held can be
        replayed by the sequences <1> .. <n>, <0> is replaced
        with the full path name by the pattern. A range of
        consecutive names can be specified by separating the
        first and last numbers in the range with a comma. For
        example, <1-n> is the same with <0>.
  -h, --help
        Display this help and exit.
  -i, --ignore-case
        The regular expression will ignore the case.
  -r, --relative-path
        Always show relative path.

PATTERN
  The pattern expressions support both wildcard character and
  regular expressions, the regexp enclosed in angle brackets
  ("<" and ">").

                       Its value is the location of the  current
                       user's profile directory, in which is found
                       that user's HKCU registry hive (NTUSER).

  greater than 0 if errors occur.
